How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is like a middle man between the working directory and
	the repository. It helps separate changes that are been tracked from the
	one that are not, before commiting then to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Comparing the version of a file in the staging area with the one already commited
	(in the repository), it's possible to determine the size of the change to be 
	commited. If the changes to the file are too big or too small, you can remove
	the file from the staging area and add it again when the changes are the right
	size.
