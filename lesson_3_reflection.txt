When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to share your work with others or have others to collaborate with you.
  Also, if you want to have a backup copy of your work.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	Because maybe you don't want to share all your changes to the public or to your team
 	before your project is ready.
